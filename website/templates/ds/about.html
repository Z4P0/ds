  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This is a blog with analysis, predictions, ramblings, and fantasies about soccer in Western New York and the larger world outside.  I am a fervent supporter of the Rochester Rhinos of USL-Pro and Tottenham Hotspur of the Barclays English Premier League.  Coverage on the site may include any of a number of topics including the Rhinos, Spurs, and New York Red Bulls, but also observations about soccer and youth development in the United States.</p>
  <p>This is that obligatory section where I describe myself and why I like to write this blog.</p>
  <p>I've been playing soccer from a young age and watching the game almost as long. Some of my earliest memories are of attending Rochester Raging Rhinos games with my family in the late 90's when the club had a serious claim at being the best team in America outside of MLS. I have this foggy memory of being one of the 12,428 fans at Frontier Field see the Rhinos beat Tampa Bay Mutiny and their star Colombian international Carlos Valderrama in 1996.</p>
  <p>I'm a huge Spurs fan and was initially drawn to the team after playing as Robbie Keane with Republic of Ireland in a Euro 2004 videogame. I often obsess about the United States Men's National Teams and daydream about the systems and mechanisms of soccer in America.</p>
  <p>I grew up in Western New York and went to college all the way over in Central New York. I spent spring semester 2012 in Puebla, Mexico and while suffering with Puebla FC (of the Primera Division) I fell in love with BUAP Lobos, the second division team located at my school. [Aauuu!!]</p>
  <p>I also support New York Red Bulls and Club Am√©rica, as well as the growth of the game across the United States.</p>
  <p>I write regularly about the Rochester Rhinos on <a href="http://www.thebentmusket.com/authors/brendan-doherty" target="_blank">The Bent Musket</a>, SB Nation's NE Revolution blog, and about Mexican soccer on <a href="http://soccernewsday.com/columnists/112/brendan-doherty" target="_blank">Soccer Newsday</a>. I've also written for <a href="http://thecup.us/author/brendandoherty/" target="_blank">TheCup.us</a>, on <a href="http://thehomeofcaribbeanfootball.wordpress.com/">The Home of Caribbean Football</a>, and like twice for <a href="http://americansoccernow.com/" target="_blank">American Soccer Now</a>.</p>
  <p>I think that's all you need to know, but feel free to ask me questions or comment on anything. Thanks for reading and if you like a post, please share it with someone.</p>
